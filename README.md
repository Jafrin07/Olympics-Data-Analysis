# 120 Years of Olympics Data Analysis (1896-2016)

## Introduction
This project analyzes data from the Olympics Games spanning from Athens 1896 to Rio 2016. The datasets used were sourced from Kaggle and include `athlete_events.csv` and `noc_regions.csv`. This analysis aims to uncover trends, patterns, and insights about athletes, countries, and events in the Olympics.

## Libraries Used
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization
- **Seaborn**: For statistical data visualization

## Dataset
The dataset was taken from Kaggle and contains the following files:
- `athlete_events.csv`: Information about athletes and their events
- `noc_regions.csv`: Mapping of NOC (National Olympic Committee) codes to country names

## Project Structure
The project includes the following sections:
1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Scripts to clean and prepare the raw data for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Jupyter notebooks containing detailed EDA to uncover trends and patterns.
3. **Visualizations**: Charts and graphs to visualize athletes' performance, medal distributions, country-wise participation, and more.
4. **Medal Distribution Analysis**: Insights into how medals have been distributed across different countries and sports over the years.
5. **Historical Insights**: Exploration of how the Olympics have evolved, including changes in events, athlete participation, and country representation.
6. **Performance Analysis**: Analysis of the performance trends of athletes and countries.
7. **Gender Analysis**: Analysis of participation and performance trends of male and female athletes.
